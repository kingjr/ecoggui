Ecog GUI
========

Ecog GUI is a Python module to localize intracranial electrodes from MRI.

It interactively fits a priori known electrodes to the MRI with a Graphical
User Interface.

This is currently an alpha version.

![demo](docs/ecoggui_animation.gif)

Example
=======
[To use the interface](examples/gui_mri_ecog):

```
from ecoggui import ElectrodeGUI
cd examples
ElectrodeGUI('T1_post_deface.nii.gz', xy=xy)
```

To understand what is happening:
* [`examples/model_displacement.py`](examples/model_displacement.py) how the 2D grid/strips are fitted with a
rotation and translation to math the 3D locations.
* [`examples/model_surface.py`](examples/model_surface.py): how the 2D grid/strips are fitted with a
2nd order polynomial with a constrain on the electrodes local distances, as we
know the grid can be flexible but are not elastic.
